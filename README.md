# Weather_App
The Open Weather App is a simple web app that fetches current weather for a city using the OpenWeather API. Users enter a city name and the app displays Temperature, Feels like, Min temp, and Max temp in Â°C. It demonstrates DOM manipulation, the Fetch API with async/await, basic error handling, and working with third-party APIs.
